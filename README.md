Compilation of data analysis with python and machine learning

## Project 1: Attrition Control

### Project Description

The objective of this project was to identify the department(s) within an organization that are most likely to experience a significant reduction in employee count. Throughout the project, I employed various Python concepts, such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, as well as fundamental programming techniques like function definition, control flow, loops, and data structures.

I encountered several challenges during the project. One of them involved merging multiple datasets into a single file, which required me to separate them appropriately. Additionally, I familiarized myself with interpreting heatmaps to gain insights from the data. Moreover, I had to develop a lengthy logical function to determine the promotion and work accident rates based on the initially separated datasets. 

Moving forward, I aspire to automate the process of inputting department names and retrieving their corresponding promotion and work accident rates, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

## Project 2: Covid-19 Analysis

### Project Description

This project aims to undertake a thorough examination of COVID-19 cases worldwide, encompassing every country. The primary focus of the analysis revolves around tracking and analyzing the figures pertaining to confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities associated with the virus - death cases. Additionally, I extended my analysis to encompass the global COVID-19 situation as a whole. Throughout the project, I leveraged essential tools such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib to demonstrate my proficiency in data visualization skills, and SimpleImputer.

During the project's progression, I faced some challenges that provided valuable learning opportunities. One such challenge involved familiarizing myself with SimpleImputer, a technique used to handle missing values by employing descriptive analysis methods such as mean, median, mode, etc. Additionally, I dedicated time to studying the concept of groupby in Python, which facilitated the aggregation and analysis of data based on specific criteria.

In conclusion, I aspire to connect this project with Power BI, a powerful visualization tool, to present the COVID-19 data on a state-level basis for each country. This integration will enhance the project's visual representation and facilitate a deeper understanding of the pandemic's impact across different regions.
