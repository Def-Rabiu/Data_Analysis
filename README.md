## Project 1: Attrition Control

### Project Description

The objective of this project was to identify the department(s) within an organization that are most likely to experience a significant reduction in employee count. Throughout the project, I employed various Python concepts, such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, as well as fundamental programming techniques like function definition, control flow, loops, and data structures.

I encountered several challenges during the project. One of them involved merging multiple datasets into a single file, which required me to separate them appropriately. Additionally, I familiarized myself with interpreting heatmaps to gain insights from the data. Moreover, I had to develop a lengthy logical function to determine the promotion and work accident rates based on the initially separated datasets. 

Moving forward, I aspire to automate the process of inputting department names and retrieving their corresponding promotion and work accident rates, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
